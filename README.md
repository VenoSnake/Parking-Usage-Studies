**Description**    : Calculates The Parking Accumulation And Parking Index, Verifies By An Approximate Area Under Curve.

# Algorithm : 

As Multiple Searches Are Done, Sorting Was Done Before To Reduce The Overhead Of Time, Thereby Followed By A             Searching Algorithm (Binary Search), Approximate Area Under Curve Was Calculated Using Area Of A Polygon.

# Algorithm In Action : 

  **Input Given: Vehicle Number Plate Recorded Among Various Time Slots**
